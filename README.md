# asana column toggle

Chrome extension to toggle visibility of columns in Asana boards.

Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asana-column-toggle/liblbldpjffmmghimkblofabpljgkjmn).
To open the panel, `ctrl+u`.

TODO:
* Reset state and reload boards on navigation
  * This is actually not easy, because Asana is a React/weird internal framework app
* Clean up the code
* Move it to a background page instead of a content script
